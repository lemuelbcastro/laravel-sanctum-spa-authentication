## Postman Collection 

There as some prerequisites to emulate a first-party SPA using Postman. `Sanctum` states that your SPA and API must share the same top-level domain so you'll have to serve the app on `localhost`. `Sanctum` also checks the incoming requests if it is stateful or not through the `Referer` header, thus the header should contain the expected URL of the SPA and it should match the defined stateful domains on the `Sanctum` configuration file or the `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS` environment variable.

Published documentation of the Postman collection can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8446183/TVRec9wE). You can run the collection by clicking the `â–º Run in Postman` button on the documentation page. The `Development` environment must be set as the active environment.
